# 🧭 GRC Projects

This section of my lab focuses on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) projects.  
I’m using this area to apply what I’ve learned from cybersecurity frameworks and standards.

## 📘 Planned Projects
- **ISO 27001 Gap Analysis** – identify control coverage using Annex A
- **SOC 2 Mapping** – align internal policies with Trust Services Criteria
- **Risk Register** – document and prioritize organizational risks
- **Policy Hierarchy** – show relationships from policy → standard → procedure
- **Control Framework Comparisons** – compare ISO, NIST, and CIS frameworks

*Work in progress as I continue to build out my GRC experience.*
