# 🧠 Home Network Lab

This repo is where I’m tracking what I’ve learned (and broken, then fixed) while building out my home network.  
Each project is hands-on and tied to something I actually run in my house.

## 🧩 Projects So Far

### 1) Pi-hole (Ad-blocking DNS)
Running Pi-hole in Docker on my **HP All-in-One (Ubuntu)** box.  
It’s handling DNS for my personal network and letting me see which domains my devices talk to most.  
Testing with `dig` helped me confirm query flow through the **ER605**.  
Pi-hole has a static IP `192.168.10.148` and is currently limited to my main VLAN.

### 2) VLAN Segmentation
Goal: separate **personal**, **work**, and **IoT** traffic across my wired network.  
The **Omada ER605** handles routing and VLAN assignment, while my **EdgeSwitch 8-Port 150W** enforces port-level segmentation.  
The **TP-Link BE550** handles Wi-Fi and acts as a router within the Omada system.

## 🔧 Verified VLAN Configuration (EdgeSwitch 8-Port 150W)

| VLAN ID | VLAN Name  | Port 1 | Port 2 | Port 3 | Port 4 | Port 5 | Port 6 | Port 7 | Port 8 | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **1** | default | U | E | U | U | T | E | E | E | Home VLAN (untagged on 1,3,4; trunk on 5) |
| **20** | Work VLAN | T | U | E | E | T | E | E | E | Work VLAN (untagged on 2; trunk on 5) |
| **30** | IoT VLAN | T | E | E | E | T | E | E | E | IoT VLAN (tagged on 1,5) |

**Legend:**  
- **U = Untagged**  
- **T = Tagged**  
- **E = Excluded**

**Summary**
- Port 1: Uplink to router (untagged VLAN 1, tagged VLAN 20 & 30)  
- Port 2: Work laptop (untagged VLAN 20)  
- Port 3–4: Personal/home (untagged VLAN 1)  
- Port 5: Trunk between switches (tagged VLAN 20 & 30, untagged VLAN 1)  
- Ports 6–8: Not used yet

## 🧰 Current Stack
- **Routers:** Omada ER605 and TP-Link BE550 (Wi-Fi 7)  
- **Switches:** EdgeSwitch 8-Port 150W and EdgeSwitch 8XP  
- **Controller:** Omada Software Controller  
- **DNS:** Pi-hole (Docker on Ubuntu) – `192.168.10.148`  
- **Workstation:** Windows Surface (admin access)  
- **Work Laptop:** Connected via Lenovo USB-C Dock (40AY0090US) on VLAN 20

## 🧭 Next Steps
- Add Omada APs that support VLAN tagging.  
- Extend Pi-hole DNS coverage across all VLANs.  
- Begin documenting automation and monitoring using Node-RED.

## 🗒 Notes
This repo is more like a lab journal than a polished guide.  
Configs are live and evolve as I learn — everything here reflects what’s actually running in my setup.
